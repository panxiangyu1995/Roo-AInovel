**Roo-AINovel** is a VSCode extension for AI-assisted novel creation developed from [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code). It transforms Roo Code's intelligent code editing capabilities into a novel creation assistance tool, helping authors with conceptualization, outline generation, chapter writing, and content refinement.

## Project Origin

Roo-AINovel is based on Roo Code (a VSCode extension for intelligent code editing with AI) and extends its powerful AI assistance capabilities from the realm of code editing to literary creation. We've maintained the core architecture and AI interaction capabilities of the original project, while redesigning the interface, tools, and functionalities to fully adapt them to the novel creation process.

---

## Why This Extension?

The creator loves reading novels and has attempted writing novels before, but struggled due to writing skill limitations. After learning about AI applications and exploring various AI novel tools, the idea of creating an AI novel tool emerged.

---

## Why as a VSCode Extension?

There are too many advantages:
1. VSCode is an excellent text editor, suitable for all text editing scenarios including novel writing - it's almost overqualified for writing novels.
2. Git can be used for novel management.
3. VSCode AI plugins like ROOcode, Cline, and Cursor are all based on VSCode modifications. These tools have mature AI integration, making them ideal for adaptation into AI novel applications.
4. The creator learned to use AI tools like ROOcode and Cline for coding during the AI learning process, and this project was coded using these AI code tools.
5. The creator hopes to provide a better environment and tools for those who want to write their own novels.
6. Future integration with other services is convenient, such as cloud service support and MCP service usage.

## What can Roo-AINovel do?

- üìù **Text Generation** - Create high-quality novel content and chapters
- üèóÔ∏è **Structure Building** - Design complete novel frameworks and character relationships
- üîç **Error Correction** - Diagnose and fix textual problems
- ‚ú® **Content Enhancement** - Optimize writing style, dialogues, and scene descriptions
- üî¨ **Novel Analysis** - Analyze the style, structure, and themes of the work
- üé¨ **Script Adaptation** - Convert novel content to professional script format
- üé≠ **Style Imitation** - Create content that mimics the style of specific authors
- üí° **Creative Inspiration** - Provide creative ideas and methods from multiple perspectives
- üñºÔ∏è **Visual Text Mode** - Create downloadable mixed text and image documents

## Quick Start

1. Install VS Code
2. Install the Roo-AINovel extension
3. Configure the AI model interface (compatible with various AI service providers)
4. Start your first creative task

## Intelligent Tools

Roo-AINovel is equipped with powerful creation assistance tools:

- File Reading and Writing - Operate directly with your novel files in VS Code
- Novel Structure Generator - Quickly create novel frameworks and chapter outlines
- Format Converter - Freely convert between formats such as Markdown, TXT, Word, etc.
- Novel Annotations - Annotate important AI creative intentions for reference during revisions
- Novel Style Imitation - Learn from others to develop your own unique style

## Key Features

- **Novel Creation Focused** - AI assistant fully customized for the novel creation process
- **Multimodal Support** - Comprehensive support for text generation, structural planning, style analysis, etc.
- **Format Diversity** - Compatible with multiple file formats and export options
- **Local Deployment** - Compatible with local AI models to protect creative privacy
- **Open Architecture** - Based on the MCP protocol, with unlimited expandable functionalities
- **VSCode Integration** - Seamless integration with the popular editor, providing a familiar creation environment
- **Framework Files as Rules** - Using outlines as rules for creation ensures consistent reference to the framework while writing, with real-time framework update capabilities (can be enabled in settings) - meaning content that deviates from the outline will automatically update the framework.

## Future Development

- Optimize analysis mode to analyze various factors of completed novels saved in the working directory, such as characters, environmental backgrounds, writing styles, etc., for learning reference
- Add knowledge base integration, with web crawlers or browser automation to generate local knowledge bases
- Add cloud analysis functions to analyze which novel content is particularly popular with readers recently, analyze which reader preferences novel ratings reflect, or read and summarize reader comments on published novels from novel websites or apps, providing reference for future novel serialization
